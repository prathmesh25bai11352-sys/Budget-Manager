# Project Statement (Personal Budget Tracker)

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to maintain awareness of their daily spending, leading to budget overruns and difficulty achieving savings goals. The problem is the lack of an accessible, easy-to-use tool for quickly logging income and expenses and viewing a consolidated financial status.

## Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is limited to a single-user, command-line application that performs core transaction tracking and provides summary reporting. It focuses on the fundamental application of Python programming concepts, data structures (List of Dictionaries), and file I/O (JSON persistence). It does not include features like user authentication, multi-currency support, or advanced graphical analytics.

## Target Users

The primary target users are:

1. Students: Seeking a simple, code-based tool to manage their limited personal funds.
2. Individuals: Who prefer a minimal, fast interface over complex accounting software for basic expense tracking.
3. Beginner Programmers: Who can use the source code as a practical example of a modular, functional Python application.

## High-Level Features

*   Transaction Recording: Log income and expenditure data.
*   Summary Calculation: Compute overall balance.
*   Category Grouping: Provide an expense breakdown by category.
*   Data Saving: Persist all data locally using a structured format (JSON).
